	The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with 		a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social 	predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother 		for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

	The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling , 		although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day. Monkeys are generally considered 	to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.

	crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used 	even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and 	false gharial (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.

	Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language has several words to describe these animals at various ages. A 	baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is sometimes called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not had any offspring. The 	term usually refers to immature females; after giving birth to her first calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male is known as a bull. Many male 	cattle are castrated to reduce their aggressive tendencies and make them more tractable. Young neutered males, which are primarily raised for beef, are called 	steers or bullocks, whereas adult neutered males,which are usually used for draft purposes, are known as oxen. A group of cows, cattle, or kine (an archaic 	term for more than one cow) constitutes a herd. English lacks a gender-neutral singular form, and so “cow” is used for both female individuals and all domestic 	bovines.
